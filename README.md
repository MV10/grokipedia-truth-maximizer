# Grokipedia Truth Maximizer <img src="https://github.com/MV10/grokipedia-truth-maximizer/blob/master/extension/icons/icon32.png" height="32px"/>

A Chromium browser extension which finds matching [Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com) pages when you're viewing Wikipedia.

* Displays a banner with the Grokipedia link.
* Does not interfere with the Wikipedia content.
* Ignores non-article pages (home page, editing, etc.)
* Correctly recognizes `#` anchor-tag navigation and retains if available.
* Right-click the icon to toggle automatic navigation.
* Probably only works with the English-language sites.
* Requires a Grokipedia account (likely your X.com account).

This does not store, require, or use any personal data or similar sensitive information.

Elon has clearly stated his goal for Grok is to "maximize truth-seeking", and that mission-statement extends to Grokipedia. Meanwhile, Wikipedia has gained a reputation for gatekeeping an _opinionated_ view of the truth. Because Grokipedia is so new, article availability is hit-or-miss, plus many sources still tend to use Wikipedia by default. I found myself wishing for a way to check Grokipedia first -- then decided to do something about it.

A future release may allow you to submit a Grokipedia content-request if there is no match for the Wikipedia article you're viewing.

Pull-requests are welcome.
